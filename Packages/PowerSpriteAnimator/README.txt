This uses the PowerSprite Animator package with the 2022 patch.

The files for the 2022 patch are publicly available at https://forum.unity.com/threads/powersprite-animator-edit-your-sprite-animations-in-style.433804/page-4#post-8203992 so they are included in git, but the rest of the files are part of the paid package so they aren't included on git.
